Manual Grin payment in WordPress platform
This plugin is created with Chatgpt's help, hope it would help somebody who wants to spread Grin cryptocurrency by WordPress platform.

Features:
1 Get the real time price from Coingecko on pair GRIN/USD
2. Convert the total cost in cart and checkout page from USD to GRIN value, to let the buyer send that amount to my address stated in checkout page.
3. Email of new order with Grin amount inside will be sent to customer.

Note: The payment process is totally in manual mode: Customer will send slatepack code to shop owner (e.g by email) with same Grin amount, then shop owner will reply to the customer with the responsed slatepack to finalize the transaction. Hope in near future, we could automate such complicated privacy process.

Code is tested to work well on 24-Nov-2024:
WordPress 6.7.1
Theme Flatsome 3.19.7
Woocommerce 9.4.2
